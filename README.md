PLACEHOLDER CEPB GITHUB FRONT PAGE

this is the front page for the cepb org github page. the idea is that for things like the SLR data, which francesca and mark originally developed and now others are using as a lab resource, this is a whre replication repositories can live when you go to publish a paper and say "hey all the stuffy ou need to reproduce this paper is at this url." the repo-specific URL can then have a readme page where you talk about the paper, etc. development DOES NOT have to occur on the cepb page, also possible to fork a copy over as sort of a final version or whatever.
